# Q-Learning
This project implements Q-learning-based path planning algorithms and comparisons with classical planners.

## Dataset Setup

To use the dataset:

1. Unzip the file `map_dataset.zip`.
2. Rename the extracted folder to `data`.
3. Move the `data` folder to the same directory level as the `main_code` folder.  
   (i.e., `data/` and `main_code/` should be in the same folder.)
